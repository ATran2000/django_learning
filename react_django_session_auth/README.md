# About

The code in this directory was written by following the Building a user authentication app with React and Django Rest Framework youtube video taught by the Django road youtube channel.
Through the video, I was able to authenticate the user. In addition, sessionid cookies are created on the client server when the user logins which allows the user to stay logged in when the user rerenders the page.<br>
