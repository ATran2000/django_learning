# About

The code in this directory was written by following the Django + React Notes App youtube video taught by Dennis Ivy.
Through the video, I was able to create a simple React/Django application where the user is able to manage their notes with simple CRUD features.
ReactJS was used for the frontend and Django was used for the backend through the Django Rest Framework.<br>
