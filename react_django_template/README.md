# About

I created my own ReactJS/Django starting template with sessions authentication. The code is based off of two youtube tutorials I followed about how to create a ReactJS/Django authentication app 
using JWT authentication and sessions authentication.
Take note that the frontend needs to run at an origin of 127.0.0.1:3000 instead of localhost:3000.<br><br>
For more information about the two tutorials, check out the following github subdirectories in the django_learning directory:
 - react_django_session_auth
 - react_django_simplejwt_auth
